## BACKGROUND

Intrapartum-related disorders are responsible for 25% of the world's neonatal death and contribute to almost 50% of the 2.6 million third trimester stillbirths and are a significant burden to healthcare in low-income countries.  In 2010, for example, 1.15 million infants developed neonatal brain damage due to some intrapartum hypoxic events, 90% of these complications taking place in low and middle-income countries.

WHO's recent report on trends in maternal mortality from 2000 to 2017 praised Rwanda for being one of the few developing countries that achieved the highest average annual rate of reduction (ARR) in global maternal mortality ratio (with ARR > 7%). While Rwanda has achieved a remarkable decline in its maternal mortality, a great deal of work remains to be done to meet the Government of Rwanda (GoR)'s target. For example, the GoR's Vision 2050 has the ambition to decrease the maternal mortality rate by 75% and infant mortality rate by 24% by the year 2035. Unfortunately, as echoed by UNICEF's recent report on Rwanda's health budget—due to a shortage of qualified obstetrics and gynecology doctors— such ambitious goals are unlikely to materialize unless the GoR introduces innovations to reduce maternal mortality in the medium and long term. For instance, as of January 2020, Rwanda has a population of around 13 million but only 57 obstetrics and gynecology doctors work in the public hospitals in Rwanda.

## OUR SOLUTION

In all public hospitals in Rwanda, intrapartum cardiotocography (CTG) is used during childbirth to monitor the heart rate of the baby and the mother's uterine contractions. A CTG graph can help to evaluate the baby's well-being and identify babies at risk of hypoxia during labor and to decide whether the baby will be delivered by instrumental vaginal birth or by cesarean section.

During childbirth, obstetricians visually examine the morphological variations in CTG traces to identify the health status of a fetus. This approach, however, is unreliable and has poor reproducibility because the interpretation is often subjective and varies from one obstetrician to another. Moreover, the fetus's heart rate variability is influenced by the brain's parasympathetic and sympathetic activities and its patterns are affected by several other stimuli such as uterine contractions. Consequently, intrapartum fetal monitoring must also consider a physiological viewpoint instead of just focusing on the morphological appearance of the fetal heart rate. CTG traces contain complex information about the baby's condition and identification of the baby's hypoxemia (e.g., low blood oxygen). Thus, proper CTG interpretation requires the medical personnel to have a good understanding of the physiology of the fetus during childbirth and other compensatory mechanisms of the fetus. Finally, several human factors such as distraction, tiredness, pressure, and stress complicate CTG interpretation and may lead to fatal outcomes. For example, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' report on perinatal mortality in the UK shows that 66% of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and brain injuries of term babies in labor in 2017 are due to errors of interpretation of CTG and failure to act upon suspicious or pathological CTG.

In the context of Rwanda, due to a severe lack of qualified obstetricians and the large number of deliveries each obstetrician is expected to perform daily, the available CTG machines are often not put to good use and their outputs are poorly interpreted. When CTG interpretation is ambiguous, out of an abundance of caution, obstetricians often resort to unnecessary and costly emergency cesarean sections instead of waiting for a natural vaginal birth.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">OVERVIEW OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE: The device is pluggable into an existing CTG, uses a cheap WIFI router for intranet communication (thus, no internet is required), and provides a centralized monitoring mechanism that allows a single obstetrician to monitor several mothers at the same time on a single large screen..</figcaption>

This clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of an Intelligent Cardiotocography with Real-Time Alerts for an Improved Labor and delivery. The development of the device and the clinical trial are fully sponsored by Spiker Ltd, a Japanese healthcare company. 

The device is ow-cost and is pluggable into an existing CTG and requires no modification to the CTG’s hardware. This device is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered clinical decision support (CDS) and analyses the CTG traces in real-time to assess the fetus's well-being. The CDS system requires no internet connection and provides mechanisms to allow early detection of fetal distress and facilitated obstetricians in making a rapid and evidence-informed decision during childbirth.  It is also designed to help reduce labor-intensive CTG monitoring tasks; thus, allowing obstetricians to spend time on other high-priority responsibilities. In particular, the proposed CDS system will help in decision-making during labor and will send alerts to medical personnel if an abnormal CTG is detected to expedite investigations of special cases that might need urgent medical interventions.
