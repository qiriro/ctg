## WHAT IS AI-CTG?

AI-CTG is a low-cost, intelligent and pluggable clinical decision support system for a rapid intrapartum cardiotocography interpretation during childbirth. 

AI-CTG is a low-cost, Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Clinical Decision Support (CDS)
system for an automatic cardiotocography (CTG) interpretation during childbirth. The device is fully functional and has been approved by the Rwanda Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be installed and tested in Rwandan hospitals. 

## WHAT IS A CARDIOTOCOGRAPY?


## HOW DOES THE DEVICE WORK?

The CDS system interfaces to an existing CTG machine and intuitively interprets its CTG traces. The proposed system is hoped to offer an improved, less subjective, and more reliable method for CTG interpretation and allow non expert obstetricians to perform an evidence-based CTG interpretation. An automatic CTG interpretation is expected to mitigate human error and skill limitations; therefore improve clinical outcomes for mothers and babies.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">OVERVIEW OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE: The device is pluggable into an existing CTG, uses a cheap WIFI router for intranet communication (thus, no internet is required), and provides a centralized monitoring mechanism that allows a single obstetrician to monitor several mothers at the same time on a single large screen..</figcaption>
