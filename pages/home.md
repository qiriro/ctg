## SUMMARY

I am the Principal Investigator and Researcher for a clinical trial of a new medical device that is expected to be used in Rwanda and other African countries in the near future. The clinical trial and the development of the medical device is sponsored by Spiker Ltd., a Japanese health technology company.

The device is fully functional. The protocols of the clinical trial of this devices has been approved by the [Rwanda National Ethic Committee]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /static_files/pdf/01-ethical-clearance.pdf %}) (Ethical Clearance No 29/RNEC/2022) and the clinical trial further approved by the [Rwanda Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /static_files/pdf/02-clinical-trial-approval.pdf %}) to be installed and tested in Rwandan hospitals. 

This website was created to give information related to the new device and to provide enough information to participants of the clinical trial. 

## WHAT IS THIS NEW MEDICAL DEVICE?

AI-CTG is a low-cost, intelligent and pluggable clinical decision support system for a rapid intrapartum cardiotocography interpretation during childbirth.

This device is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered clinical decision support (CDS) and analyses the CTG traces in real-time to assess the fetus's well-being. The CDS system requires no internet connection and provides mechanisms to allow early detection of fetal distress and facilitated obstetricians in making a rapid and evidence-informed decision during childbirth.  It is also designed to help reduce labor-intensive CTG monitoring tasks; thus, allowing obstetricians to spend time on other high-priority responsibilities. In particular, the proposed CDS system will help in decision-making during labor and will send alerts to medical personnel if an abnormal CTG is detected to expedite investigations of special cases that might need urgent medical interventions.

## WHAT IS A CTG?
[Cardiotocography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiotocography) is a technique to monitor heart rate and rhytm of a unborn baby (fetus) in her mother's womb and is normally used during late pregnancy and labor and helps the medical doctors identify babies at risks of lack of oxygen and to decide whether to performemergency delivery via instrumental vaginal birth or by cesarean section. 

## HOW DOES THE DEVICE WORK?

The CDS system interfaces to an existing CTG machine and intuitively interprets its CTG traces. The proposed system is hoped to offer an improved, less subjective, and more reliable method for CTG interpretation and allow non expert obstetricians to perform an evidence-based CTG interpretation. An automatic CTG interpretation is expected to mitigate human error and skill limitations; therefore improve clinical outcomes for mothers and babies.

The device uses advanced signal processign and cutting edge algorithms that closely follows the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)'s guideline on intrapartum fetal monitoring and provide a timely and evidence-based interpretation of a CTG during childbirth. 

## EXPECTED IMPACT
The device is expected to provide the following impacts:

### Reduction of unnecessary cesarean section by 20% in the first year and by 50% reduction in the next 5 years

Poor CTG interpretation leads to a high false-positive rate of pathological CTG, which,  out of an abundance of caution, obstetricians perform unnecessary emergency intrapartum cesarean sections for fetal distress. Recent studies show that proper CTG interpretation and its use in conjunction with fetal ECG ST segment analysis (STAN) lead to a statistically significant reduction of intrapartum emergency cesarean section and the rate of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) due to CTG misinterpretation can be reduced by 50%. In our pilot test, it was found that the device achieved more than 3,000 cases of APGAR (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration) score greater than 8, and no unnecessary cesarean section was performed when using this device. 
### Reduce risks of neonatal seizures by 20% in the first year and by 50% in the next five years**. 

Neonatal seizures are sudden abnormal modifications of a baby's electrographic activity during the neonatal period. It is estimated that neonatal seizures occur in 3 per 1000 live births and are much higher in preterm infants. Neonatal seizure is particularly high in rural low and middle-income countries. For instance, in Kenya's rural districts, neonatal seizures are associated with a 22.5% mortality rate, which is much higher compared to developed countries. Studies conducted around the world show that continuous use of CTG monitoring in labor halved the risk of neonatal seizures, and this reduction is consistent across several subgroups.

### To reduce birth asphyxia by 10% in the first year and by 20% in the next five years

Birth asphyxia (i.e., the insufficient flow of blood or oxygen exchange to or/and from the fetus before, during, or after birth) affects 23% of births worldwide and up to 39% of births at district hospitals in Rwanda. Birth asphyxia is associated with cerebral palsy and long-term impairments such as learning difficulties. The developed device will provide a rapid and accurate interpretation of a cardiotocograph (CTG) during childbirth; thus, allowing rapid identification of pathological  CTG that might be associated with birth hypoxia and asphyxia. This will allow the medical personnel to take timely action and appropriate to prevent birth asphyxia.

### To reduce the time and training required to properly interpret a CTG graph

The device is designed to automatically streamline operations and CTG measures (e.g., risk definition, contractions, baseline rate, variability, accelerations, decelerations, and overall impression) that are required to properly interpret a CTG graph. In our test, it was shown that it takes less than 1 days for a novice medical personnel to learn how to independently interpret a CTG when he/she used our device.
