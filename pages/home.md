# WHAT IS AI-CTG 
AI-CTG is a low-cost, intelligent and pluggable clinical decision support system for a rapid intrapartum cardiotocography interpretation during childbirth. 

It is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Clinical Decision Support (CDS)
system for an automatic cardiotocography (CTG) interpretation. The CDS system interfaces to an existing CTG machine and intuitively interprets its CTG traces. The proposed system is hoped to offer an improved, less subjective, and more reliable method for CTG interpretation and allow non expert obstetricians to perform an evidence-based CTG interpretation. An automatic CTG interpretation is expected to mitigate human error and skill limitations; therefore improve clinical outcomes for mothers and babies.
