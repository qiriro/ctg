## SUMMARY

I am the Principal Investigator and Researcher for a clinical trial of a new medical device that is expected to be used in Rwanda and other African countries in the near future. The clinical trial and the development of the medical device is sponsored by Spiker Ltd., a Japanese health technology company.

The device is fully functional. The protocols of the clinical trial of this devices has been approved by the [Rwanda National Ethic Committee]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /static_files/pdf/01-ethical-clearance.pdf %}) (Ethical Clearance No 29/RNEC/2022) and the clinical trial further approved by the [Rwanda Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /static_files/pdf/02-clinical-trial-approval.pdf %}) to be installed and tested in Rwandan hospitals. 

This website was created to give information related to the new device and to provide enough information to participants of the clinical trial. 

## WHAT IS THIS NEW MEDICAL DEVICE?

AI-CTG is a low-cost, intelligent and pluggable clinical decision support system for a rapid intrapartum cardiotocography interpretation during childbirth. 

This device is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered clinical decision support (CDS) and analyses the CTG traces in real-time to assess the fetus's well-being. The CDS system requires no internet connection and provides mechanisms to allow early detection of fetal distress and facilitated obstetricians in making a rapid and evidence-informed decision during childbirth.  It is also designed to help reduce labor-intensive CTG monitoring tasks; thus, allowing obstetricians to spend time on other high-priority responsibilities. In particular, the proposed CDS system will help in decision-making during labor and will send alerts to medical personnel if an abnormal CTG is detected to expedite investigations of special cases that might need urgent medical interventions.

## WHAT IS A CTG?
[Cardiotocography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiotocography) is a technique to monitor heart rate and rhytm of a unborn baby (fetus) in her mother's womb and is normally used during late pregnancy and labor and helps the medical doctors identify babies at risks of lack of oxygen and to decide whether to performemergency delivery via instrumental vaginal birth or by cesarean section.

## HOW DOES THE DEVICE WORK?

The CDS system interfaces to an existing CTG machine and intuitively interprets its CTG traces. The proposed system is hoped to offer an improved, less subjective, and more reliable method for CTG interpretation and allow non expert obstetricians to perform an evidence-based CTG interpretation. An automatic CTG interpretation is expected to mitigate human error and skill limitations; therefore improve clinical outcomes for mothers and babies.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">OVERVIEW OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE: The device is pluggable into an existing CTG, uses a cheap WIFI router for intranet communication (thus, no internet is required), and provides a centralized monitoring mechanism that allows a single obstetrician to monitor several mothers at the same time on a single large screen..</figcaption>

The device uses advanced signal processign and cutting edge algorithms that closely follows the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)'s guideline on intrapartum fetal monitoring and provide a timely and evidence-based interpretation of a CTG during childbirth.
